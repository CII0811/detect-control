自動判斷空間內的溫度控制風扇開關，並透過電腦視窗觀看當下空間內的狀況
Automatically control the fan switch based on the temperature in the space, and view the current conditions in the space through a computer window.

成功將arduino上溫溼度感測器的數值讀進python顯示在視窗上，並且將判斷結果回傳給arduino控制風扇的開關。手動變換最高溫度和退出鍵的部分也都可以順利進行。
Successfully read the values from the temperature and humidity sensor on the Arduino into Python and display them in a window. 
The judgment results are also sent back to the Arduino to control the fan switch. The manual adjustment of the maximum temperature and the exit key functions are also working smoothly.

希望後續可以將數值儲存成excel檔，以便紀錄和之後的數值做對比，也能隨時查看先前資料。更改為無線網路傳輸，可以在遠端也接收到當下溫室內的數值，
即時監控會更加方便有效率。除了溫溼度之外，還可以增加光度、風速等等的數值，讓溫室內的環境可以更穩定。控制的部分也可以增加自動加水、補光等等的功能。
I hope that in the future, the values can be saved as an Excel file for record-keeping and comparison with future data, 
allowing for easy review of previous records. Switching to wireless transmission would enable receiving real-time greenhouse data remotely, 
making monitoring more convenient and efficient. In addition to temperature and humidity, 
values such as light intensity and wind speed can be added to create a more stable greenhouse environment. 
The control system can also be enhanced with functions like automatic watering and supplemental lighting
